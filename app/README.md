# LEPTON app (Workstream F)

The LEPTON web app: React and TypeScript on Vite, React Router for the screens and MapLibre GL
JS for the map. It is a static site with no server: `python -m src.app_data` (F2) writes every
number to small JSON files in `public/data/`, and the app only draws them.

## Run it

Needs Node.js 22.12 or newer (`node --version`); Vite 8 and MapLibre need it. From this
folder:

```
npm install      # once, and again after package.json changes
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173, reloads when you save
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Type-checks, then writes the site to `dist/` (not in git) |
| `npm run preview` | Serves `dist/` at http://localhost:4173, as Vercel will |
| `npm run lint` | Oxlint, the code checker |

Versions are pinned in `package.json`; `package-lock.json` pins the rest. Commit both after
adding a package (`npm install --save-exact <name>@<version>`).

## Where things are

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/router.tsx` | The routes: which screen each address shows |
| `src/screens/` | One file per screen. Each is a placeholder until its task builds it |
| `src/styles/tokens.css` | Every color, corner radius, spacing step and text style, from Figma |
| `src/styles/global.css` | Page-wide base styles |
| `src/lib/maplibre.ts` | MapLibre, set up for Vite; map code imports it from here |
| `public/data/` | F2's data files, fetched as `/data/<file>` |
| `vercel.json` | Sends every screen's address to the app on Vercel |
| `vite.config.ts` | Vite's settings; a missing `/data/` file answers 404 here too, as on Vercel |

## Screens

The three map levels share `MapLayout.tsx`, so the one map stays on screen while the reader
drills down; each level's own content shows inside it. Figma node ids are in each file.

| Route | Screen | File | Task |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Home | `Home.tsx` | F6 |
| `/map` | Map: Metro Manila | `MapMetroManila.tsx` | F4 |
| `/map/quezon-city` | Map: Quezon City's case forecast | `MapQuezonCity.tsx` | F4 |
| `/map/quezon-city/prophylaxis` | Map: prophylaxis plan | `MapProphylaxis.tsx` | F5 |
| `/leptospirosis` | Leptospirosis, for residents | `Leptospirosis.tsx` | F7 |
| `/exposed` | The "I have been exposed to floodwater" guide | `Exposed.tsx` | F8 |
| `/compare` | Compare models | `CompareModels.tsx` | F9 |
| `/how-it-works` | How it works | `HowItWorks.tsx` | F10 |

Any other address, and any error while drawing a screen, shows `ErrorPage.tsx`. When a screen
is built, it stops using `Placeholder.tsx`; delete that file (and `Placeholder.css`) when no
screen uses it.

A setting kept in the address's query (F4's forecast week) should change with
`setSearchParams(next, { preventScrollReset: true })`; otherwise the page jumps to the top.

## Design tokens

`src/styles/tokens.css` holds the Figma file's variables and text styles (Foundations page),
under the names Figma's code syntax gives them. Use them for every color, corner and gap; never
write a hex color or a one-off radius or gap anywhere else.

| Kind | Use | Values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Colors (30) | `var(--color-bg-canvas)`, `var(--color-text-primary)`, `var(--color-data-ramp-3)` | The Theme collection, Clinic mode |
| Corners | `var(--radius-xs)` badges, `-sm` tabs and fields, `-md` buttons, `-lg` cards and panels | 2, 4, 6, 8 px |
| Spacing | `var(--space-1)` to `var(--space-9)` | 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96 px |
| Text (15) | `className="heading-m"`, `"body-m"`, `"data-xl"`, ... (Figma's Heading/M is `.heading-m`) | Figtree 400, 500, 600 |

Clinic (light) is the app's theme. The dark themes, Monsoon and Ember, are in the file too, for
a later theme switch: `<html data-theme="monsoon">`. If the design changes, change Figma first,
then `tokens.css`, keeping the names.

Every CSS file ends up in one stylesheet that applies on every page, so two files that use the
same class name change each other's screens without any error. Start each class with its
file's name: `.home-hero` in `Home.css`, `.button-primary` in `Button.css`.

## Maps

Import MapLibre from `src/lib/maplibre.ts`, not from `'maplibre-gl'`:

```ts
import maplibregl from '../lib/maplibre.ts'
```

It hands MapLibre the address of its web worker, which Vite would otherwise leave out of the
build (every GeoJSON layer would fail with "Worker failed to load"). MapLibre 6 has no default
export of its own, so `import maplibregl from 'maplibre-gl'` from older tutorials fails.
React runs each effect twice in development (`StrictMode`), so create the map in a `useEffect`
and call `map.remove()` in its cleanup.

MapLibre adds about 1 MB of JavaScript. Import it only in the map screens, and load the `/map`
routes with React Router's `lazy` in `router.tsx`, so Home and the phone guide do not
download it.

## Deploy (Vercel)

The app is hosted on Vercel's free plan, built from this repository with `app/` as the root
directory. One-time setup, by the owner of the GitHub repository:

1. Sign in at vercel.com with GitHub.
2. Add New, then Project, then import `Project-Lepton`.
3. Set Root Directory to `app`. Vercel detects Vite: build command `npm run build`, output
   directory `dist`. Deploy.
4. Share the production link with the team.

After that, every push to `main` updates the production link, and every pull request gets its
own preview link. `vercel.json` sends every address except `/data/` and `/assets/` files to
`index.html`, so a link such as `/map/quezon-city` opens directly, while a data file that does
not exist answers 404, not with the page. `vite.config.ts` makes `npm run dev` and
`npm run preview` answer the same way, so `if (!res.ok)` after `fetch` is the test for a
missing file everywhere.
